## Class Project for "Getting and Cleaning Data"

The class project for [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata) was to read in the ["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), perform an analysis on the data set, and output a tidy data set.

## Requirements

You should create one R script called *run_analysis.R* that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Overview

In this repository, you find:

- *run_analysis.R* : the R-code run on the data set

- *tidydata.txt* : the clean data extracted from the original data using *run_analysis.R*

- *CodeBook.md* : the CodeBook reference to the variables in *tidydata.txt*

- *README.md* : the analysis of the code in *run_analysis.R*
